    This process will change the status of an Out With Permission resident back to current resident
    (OWP is an exception to stay out past curfew or for a night). Please provide detail in the note regarding the
    resident’s status (ex. time of return, interesting occurrences around return, etc.)
</p>
<p>
Please note – If the individual is moving out after not returning for 3 days, or is being suspended from the shelter,
    you need to use either the Outtake or Suspension processes.
    OWP Return is only used for the return of a resident to current resident.
