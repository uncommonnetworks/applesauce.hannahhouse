<p>This process will add an individual to the list of potential intakes for the day (to do list). It will also create a note on the dashboard of a potential intake. Please do the best possible to accurately spell the name of the individual, as it will query the database for individuals with names spelled the same.

    Please note:


<ul>
    <li>This will not create a profile</li>
<li>These individuals will automatically disappear from the to do list after midnight if they have not completed an intake</li>
    </ul>
